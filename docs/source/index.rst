Surface's documentation
===================================

**Surfaces** comprises a collection of Python scripts that provide a rapid means to assess protein interactions by analyzing the atomic surface areas in contact and the types of atoms involved in the interaction.

In this document, we offer a guide on how to install and utilize the protein-protein and protein-ligand interaction evaluation functions, as well as the evaluation function of all the interactions associated with specific residues of interest. We also provide a manual for utilizing the structure preprocessing scripts necessary for each of these functions.
