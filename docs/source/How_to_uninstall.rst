How to uninstall
=====

To delete all **Surfaces** scripts and documents, you can run::

	cd ..
	rm -r Surfaces
	
Alternatively, you might manually delete these two directories.

Surfaces might have installed the dependencies contained in the file ``dependencies.txt``, that you can consult if you wish to uninstall them, as well as ``Pymol`` and ``Miniconda``.
